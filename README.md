Examples of the output files produced by the code are in the three folders (`Maize_Output`,`Teosinte_Output`,`Visualization_Output`).

The R Markdown script has been reviewed by two contributors. Their comments are provided directly on the script in separate files (`Jaqueth_Review.Rmd`,`Paulsen_Review.Rmd`).
